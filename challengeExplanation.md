## CSS Layout Challenges

##### Challenge 1

Made the divs black with white text for visibility. Floated div1 left to align to left of viewport. Used absolute positioning for divs 2 and 3 because floating them right would reverse the order that is in the comp. I set div 3 to a postition of 0 to right align to the viewport. I then used the width of the divs (200px) and a 5px margin for each div to position div2 at 210px. So, (200px div width) + (5px margin for each div = 10px) ==> 210px. Finally I removed the margin from the body so all divs were touching edges.
